## About
An engine/framework for my personal graphics/gamedev experiments.

## Features
* Object hierarchies/scene graph.
* Component system: scenes consist of nodes, nodes hold any number of components. Components implement all in-game logic and allow building flexible and modular architecture. Inspired by Unity.
* OBJ meshes and PNG textures loading.
* Asynchronous asset loading.
* Render to texture.
* Convenient system for applying post-processing effects.
* Basic text rendering.
* Basic physics.
* OpenGL rendering backend.
