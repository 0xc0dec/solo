## Current progress
* High-level API exposed to both C++ and Lua
* Object hierarchies/scene graph
* Component system: scenes consist of nodes, nodes hold any number of components. Components hold all in-game logic and allow building flexible and modular architecture. Inspired by Unity.
* OBJ meshes and PNG textures loading
* Very basic resource manager
* Render to texture
* Convenient system for applying post-processing effects
