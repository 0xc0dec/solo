### TODO
* Find a good way of handling shared_ptr in scripts. Currently trying to make getOrCreateTexture method work.
* getOrCreateMaterial by its url. Currently there's only one method left - the one that always creates a new material based on an effect.
* Use position, rotation and scale to calculate the corresponding getter method results (instead of the matrix)
* Remove methods like multiply() from math classes
