# TODO
* Make sure findComponent returns nil for inexisted components.
* Get rid of stuttering in demo. Probably happens because of GC.
* Think through script component lookup. Fix the need to specify typeId manually.
* Vulkan backend: fix various crashes, see the bak version for reference.
* Review sptr and maybe replace some of them with raw pointers.
