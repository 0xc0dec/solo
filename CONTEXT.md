# TODO
* Continue with Vulkan backend
* Rename TextureFormat -> ImageFormat or rename Image -> TextureData, or fix the ambiguity somehow else.
* Make engine Lua-only, move include/ into src/
* Make sure findComponent returns nil for inexistent components.
* Review sptr and maybe replace some of them with raw pointers.
