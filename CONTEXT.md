# TODO

* FIX panic functions to avoid evaluating their condition in release!
* Deferred demo
* Remove skybox/font renderers since their shaders are not flexible for different situations.
Let the user render them.
* Use GENERAL image layout in Vulkan for now, for simplicity
* findScriptComponent to operate on component names
* Better demos, separate scenes for separate effects, refactoring (esp. resource loading), etc.
* More error checks
* Fix todos in code
* Introduce "Standard" shader; add forward/deferred rendering paths;
