# TODO

* findScriptComponent to operate on component names
* Fix VK debug errors (esp. check post-processor errors)
* Bad error message in Vulkan when variable not declared in effect and is referenced
* Finish with shader generation: pass GLSL version as parameter, rely on it instead of "vulkan or not".
* Refactor mesh attributes lookup, introduce attribute semantics or make sure predefined attributes always called the same
* Better demos, separate scenes for separate effects, real buttons for toggling post-processing effects, etc.
* Demos refactoring, esp. texture/effect/material loading
* Use axis names in CubeTextureData for fetching layer data
* More error checks
* Fix todos in code
