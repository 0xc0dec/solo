# TODO

* Finish with shader generation: pass GLSL version as parameter, rely on it instead of "vulkan or not".
* Refactor mesh attributes lookup, introduce attribute semantics or make sure predefined attributes always called the same
* Remake built-in effects with lua format
* Better demos, separate scenes for separate effects, real buttons for toggling post-processing effects, etc.
* Demos refactoring, esp. texture/effect/material loading
* Use axis names in CubeTextureData for fetching layer data
* More error checks, write errors to console
* Make sure findComponent returns nil for inexistent components.
