# TODO

* Finish with shader generation: pass GLSL version as parameter, rely on it instead of "vulkan or not".
Add static method to Effect to create shader from single source string
* Better demos, separate scenes for separate effects, real buttons for toggling post-processing effects, etc.
* Demos refactoring, esp. texture/effect/material loading
* Use axis names in CubeTextureData for fetching layer data
* More error checks, write errors to console
* Make sure findComponent returns nil for inexistent components.
* Fix todos in code
