* Vertex format
* Index array
* Notify about transform changes
* Optimise transform: calculate global position/rotation/scale bypassing the matrix
* Use position, rotation and scale to calculate the corresponding getter method results (instead of the matrix)
* Materials, Passes, Techniques, Effects handling
* Remove methods like multiply() from math classes
