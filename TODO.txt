* Texture loading. Made basic sampler binding functionality through the material paramter; need to fill in the actual GL code
* Remove factories when not needed (for example, for internal classes)
* Models loading
* Use position, rotation and scale to calculate the corresponding getter method results (instead of the matrix)
* Remove methods like multiply() from math classes
