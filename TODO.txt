* Refactor RenderState::bind() mess in descendant classes; applyFaceCull() for material pass. Maybe remove material passes completely, because there's no need for them so far.
* Texture loading. Made basic sampler binding functionality through the material paramter; need to fill in the actual GL code.
* Models loading
* Use position, rotation and scale to calculate the corresponding getter method results (instead of the matrix)
* Remove methods like multiply() from math classes
