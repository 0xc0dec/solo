	\brief Prevents name mangling and provides a potential location to enable
	compatibility when new Lua versions are released.
	\details No part of OOLua directly includes any Lua header files, instead
	when required they include this header. Contrary to what some people may think,
	this is by design. There is no way to know if a user's version of the Lua
	library was compiled as C++ or C.
