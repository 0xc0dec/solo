/**  \addtogroup OOLuaTags Tags

\brief
Possible members for \ref OOLUA_TAGS which help express more information about
a class which is to be proxied.

	\struct OOLUA::Abstract
	\brief The class being mirrored is an abstract class.
	\details
	When OOLua encounters the \ref OOLUA::Abstract "Abstract" tag it will not
	look for any constructors for the type and the type will not be constructable
	from Lua. Specifying an \ref OOLUA_CTORS block will have no effect and such a
	block will be ignored.

	\addtogroup OperatorTags Operator Tags
	@{
		\brief Informs that a class has an operator exposed
		\details \ref OperatorTags inform OOLua that a class exposes one or more of the
		operators supported:
			\li \ref OOLUA::Less_op "Less_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Equal_op "Equal_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Not_equal_op "Not_equal_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Less_equal_op "Less_equal_op"
			\li	\ref OOLUA::Div_op "Div_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Mul_op "Mul_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Sub_op "Sub_op"
			\li \ref OOLUA::Add_op "Add_op"



	\struct OOLUA::Less_op
	\brief Less than operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Equal_op
	\brief Equal operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Not_equal_op
	\brief Not equal operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Less_equal_op
	\brief Less than or equal operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Div_op
	\brief Division operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Mul_op
	\brief Multiplication operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Sub_op
	\brief Subtraction operator is defined for the type.

	\struct OOLUA::Add_op
	\brief Addition operator is defined for the type.
	@}

	\struct OOLUA::No_default_constructor
	\brief
	There is not a default constructor in the public interface yet there are other
	constructors.
	\details
	There is not a public default constructor or you do not wish to expose such a
	constructor, yet there are other constructors which will be specified by
	\ref OOLUA_CTOR entries inside a \ref OOLUA_CTOR block.

	\struct OOLUA::No_public_constructors
	\brief There are no constructors in the public interface.
	\details
	When OOLua encounters this tag it will not look for any constructors for the
	type and the type will not be constructable from Lua. Specifying an OOLUA_CTORS
	block will have no effect and such a block will be ignored.

	\struct OOLUA::No_public_destructor
	\brief
	There is not a destructor in the public interface and OOLua will not attempt to
	delete an instance of this type

	\struct OOLUA::Register_class_enums
	\brief The class has enums to register
	\details
	The class has enums which are specified inside the OOLUA_ENUMS block, these
	entries will be registered with a lua_State when the proxy type is.

	\addtogroup SharedTags Shared Tags
	@{
		\brief Tags to override the default behaviour the library was compiled with.

	\struct OOLUA::Shared
	\brief Overrides the configuration behaviour when creating proxied types
	\details
	When the library is compiled with \ref OOLUA_USE_SHARED_PTR "shared pointer support"
	and it is not configured to create shared pointers by
	\ref OOLUA_NEW_POINTER_DEFAULT_IS_SHARED_TYPE "default", then this tag
	overrides that behaviour for the proxy type.
	\note If the library is configured to use the shared pointer type by default
	then this tag is ignored when present in a proxy \ref OOLUA_TAGS "tag block".
	\see OOLUA_USE_SHARED_PTR
	\see OOLUA_NEW_POINTER_DEFAULT_IS_SHARED_TYPE

	\struct OOLUA::No_shared
	\brief Overrides the configuration behaviour when creating proxied types
	\details
	When the library is compiled with \ref OOLUA_USE_SHARED_PTR "shared pointer support"
	and it is also configured to create shared pointers by
	\ref OOLUA_NEW_POINTER_DEFAULT_IS_SHARED_TYPE "default", then this tag
	overrides that behaviour for the proxy type.
	\note If the library is configured to not use the shared pointer type by default
	then this tag is ignored when present in a proxy \ref OOLUA_TAGS "tag block".
